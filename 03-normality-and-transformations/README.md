# Normal Distribution

Normal distribution is a core concept in statistics, the backbone of Machine Learning. It is a continuous probability distribution wherein values lie in a symmetrical fashion mostly situated around the mean.

We call this Bell-shaped curve a **Normal Distribution**. **Carl Friedrich Gauss** discovered it so sometimes we also call it a **Gaussian Distribution** as well.

## Skewed Distribution

When a normal curve slopes to the left or right, it is known as a **skewed distribution**. A long tail on the right is referred to as **right-skewed** or **positively skewed**, while a long tail on the left is referred to as **left-skewed** or **negatively skewed**.

Here, **Mode < Median < Mean**

![left.jpg](/03-normality-and-transformations/images/left.jpg)

Here, **Mode > Median > Mean**

## How to Check the Normality of a Distribution

There are many ways to determine the normality, using visualizations like **Histogram**, **KDE Plots**, etc., using the concept of **Skewness** and **Kurtosis**, or using a statistical test like **D'Agostino K^2 Test**.

## Policies for Normal Distribution

We can apply transformations to make our data Normally Distributed.
